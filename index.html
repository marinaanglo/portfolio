    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an LA Posse Scholar and I am currently a senior at Bucknell University majoring in Computer Science.

I initially came to Bucknell as a Chemical Engineering major, but found myself fascinated by the innovative, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary nature of Computer Science. In particular, I would love to go into the field of Public Interest Technology, where I can use my knowledge and experiences in CS and outside passions to make contributions that will benefit the public and serve the people. I would also love to explore Data Science and create more visualizations and observations from various datasets. I have experience in data visualization from Mozilla's Just Computing Fellowship where my research team and I investigated the carceral sequences in Pennsylvania. I am looking to expand my skills and look further into data visualization!

I am organized, driven, and passionate about work that will make the world a better place.</p>
